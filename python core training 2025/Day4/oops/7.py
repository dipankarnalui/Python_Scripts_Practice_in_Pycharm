class Modules in python :-
==========================
Rules
  1) always class name should start capital letter
  2) method names should be in lower case
  3) every methods first arg should be "self"
     which is automatically passed
  4) "self" is similar to "this" of C++/Java/C#
  5) default access specifier within class is "PUBLIC"
  6) we don't declare data members 
    - when we assign the value to the data member 
    - they get auto-declared 
    - we start using them directly
  7) all the data members should be initialized within
     the constructor ( good practice )
