CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a method used for allocating IP addresses and routing IP packets more efficiently. It replaces the old class-based system (Class A, B, C networks) by allowing more flexible division of IP address space.

Key Concepts of CIDR:
CIDR Notation: CIDR notation is written as IP_address/prefix_length, where:

IP_address is the network address.
prefix_length (the number after the /) indicates how many bits are used for the network portion of the address.
The prefix length defines the subnet mask that separates the network and host portions of the address.

Subnet Mask in CIDR: The prefix length /n tells how many bits in the IP address are dedicated to the network part. The rest of the bits are for the host addresses within that network.

For example, in 192.168.1.0/24, the /24 means the first 24 bits are used for the network (equivalent to a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0).
Example of CIDR:
Consider the CIDR notation: 192.168.10.0/26

Breaking it Down:

192.168.10.0: This is the network address.
/26: The prefix length indicates that the first 26 bits of the IP address are the network portion, and the remaining 6 bits are used for hosts.
Subnet Mask:

/26 is equivalent to the subnet mask 255.255.255.192.
The first 26 bits of the subnet mask are 1s (11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000), and the last 6 bits are 0s, which are used for hosts.
Number of Usable Hosts:

In this case, 6 bits are available for hosts, so the number of possible IP addresses is 2^6 = 64. However, 2 IP addresses are reserved (one for the network address and one for the broadcast address), leaving 64 - 2 = 62 usable addresses for hosts in this subnet.
IP Address Range:

Network address: 192.168.10.0
First usable host: 192.168.10.1
Last usable host: 192.168.10.62
Broadcast address: 192.168.10.63
Benefits of CIDR:
Efficient allocation: It allows for more efficient IP address allocation without being restricted by the fixed classes (A, B, C).
Flexible subnetting: CIDR allows for flexible division of address space based on the actual number of hosts required.
Improved routing: CIDR allows route aggregation, reducing the number of routes in the routing tables and improving the scalability of the internet.
Example with Multiple CIDR Blocks:
Suppose you are given the network 10.0.0.0/16. You can break it into smaller subnets using CIDR:

10.0.0.0/24 (256 addresses, 254 usable)
10.0.1.0/24 (256 addresses, 254 usable)
Each block can be used for different departments or services within an organization. This allows better control and management of IP addresses.

In summary, CIDR provides a more flexible and efficient way to allocate IP addresses and manage networks compared to the older class-based system.
